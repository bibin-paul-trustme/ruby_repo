cve: CVE-2018-16395
title: OpenSSL::X509::Name equality check does not work correctly
description: An instance of OpenSSL::X509::Name contains entities such as CN, C and
  so on. Some two instances of OpenSSL::X509::Name are equal only when all entities
  are exactly equal. However, there is a bug that the equality check is not correct
  if the value of an entity of the argument (right-hand side) starts with the value
  of the receiver (left-hand side). So, if a malicious X.509 certificate is passed
  to compare with an existing certificate, there is a possibility to be judged incorrectly
  that they are equal.
