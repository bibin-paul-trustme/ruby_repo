title: GitLab Grit Gem for Ruby contains a flaw allowing
  arbitrary commands to be executed
date: 2022-05-17
description: |
  The Grit gem for Ruby, as used in GitLab 5.2 before 5.4.1 and
  6.x before 6.2.3, allows remote authenticated users to execute
  arbitrary commands, as demonstrated by the search box for the
  GitLab code search feature.

  GitLab Grit Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in the app/contexts/search_context.rb
  script. The issue is triggered when input passed via the code
  search box is not properly sanitized, which allows strings to
  be evaluated by the shell. This may allow a remote attacker to
  execute arbitrary commands.
