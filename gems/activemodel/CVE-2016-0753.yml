title: Possible Input Validation Circumvention in Active Model
date: 2016-01-25

description: |
  Code that uses Active Model based models (including Active Record models) and
  does not validate user input before passing it to the model can be subject to
  an attack where specially crafted input will cause the model to skip
  validations.
