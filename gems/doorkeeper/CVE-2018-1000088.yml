title: Doorkeeper gem has stored XSS on authorization consent view

description: |
  Stored XSS on the OAuth Client's name will cause users being prompted for
  consent to be exposed to, and execute, the XSS payload.

  In order for this to occur the victim must be tricked to click an opaque link
  to the web view that runs the XSS payload. However, a malicious link version
  is virtually indistinguishable from a normal one.

  If you allow 3rd parties to create OAuth clients in your app, upgrade to the
  patched versions immediately.

  Additionally there is stored XSS in the native_redirect_uri form element.

  DWF has assigned CVE-2018-1000088.
