title: Simple Form Gem for Ruby has Incorrect Access Control for forms based on user input
date: 2019-09-25
description: |
  Simple Form before 5.0 has Incorrect Access Control in `file_method?` in `lib/simple_form/form_builder.rb`,
  because a user-supplied string is invoked as a method call.
  This only happens for pages that build forms based on user input.

patched_versions:
  - ">= 5.0"
