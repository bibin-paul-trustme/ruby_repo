title: bcrypt-ruby Gem for Ruby incorrect encoding of non US-ASCII characters (JRuby
  only)
date: 2010-02-01
description: |
  In https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-BCRYPT-20009, found
  "The advisory has been revoked - it doesn't affect any version of package bcrypt"

  bcrypt-ruby Gem for Ruby suffered from a bug related to character
  encoding that substantially reduced the entropy of hashed passwords
  containing non US-ASCII characters. An incorrect encoding step
  transparently replaced such characters by '?' prior to hashing.
  In the worst case of a password consisting solely of non-US-ASCII
  characters, this would cause its hash to be equivalent to all other
  such passwords of the same length.

  This issue only affects the JRuby implementation.

  This gem has been renamed. Please use "bcrypt" from now on.
