title: XSS vulnerability in rails-html-sanitizer
date: 2016-01-25

description: |
  Due to the way that `Rails::Html::FullSanitizer` is implemented, if an attacker
  passes an already escaped HTML entity to the input of Action View's `strip_tags`
  these entities will be unescaped what may cause a XSS attack if used in combination
  with `raw` or `html_safe`.
