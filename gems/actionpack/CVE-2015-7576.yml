title: Timing attack vulnerability in basic authentication in Action Controller
date: 2016-01-25

description: |
  There is a timing attack vulnerability in the basic authentication support
  in Action Controller. Due to the way that Action Controller compares user
  names and passwords in basic authentication authorization code, it is
  possible for an attacker to analyze the time taken by a response and
  intuit the password.
  Attackers can use this information to attempt to guess the username and
  password used in the basic authentication system.
