title: Object leak vulnerability for wildcard controller routes in Action Pack
date: 2016-01-25

description: |
  Users that have a route that contains the string ":controller" are susceptible
  to objects being leaked globally which can lead to unbounded memory growth.
  To identify if your application is vulnerable, look for routes that contain
  ":controller".
