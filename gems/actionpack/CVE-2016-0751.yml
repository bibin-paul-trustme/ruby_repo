title: Possible Object Leak and Denial of Service attack in Action Pack
date: 2016-01-25

description: |
  There is a possible object leak which can lead to a denial of service
  vulnerability in Action Pack. A carefully crafted accept header can
  cause a global cache of mime types to grow indefinitely which can lead
  to a possible denial of service attack in Action Pack.
