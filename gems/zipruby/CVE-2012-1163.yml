title: A flaw in zipruby may allow information leaks
date: 2012-03-21
description: |
  libzip (version <= 0.10) has two vulnerabilities that may lead to a heap
  overflow or an information leak via corrupted zip files. PHP (versions
  5.4.0 and <= 5.3.10) and the Ruby binding zipruby (version <= 0.3.6) are
  also affected as they include copies of affected libzip versions.
