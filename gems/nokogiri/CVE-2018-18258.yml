title: Nokogiri gem contains an upsteam vulnerability in libxml2
date: 2017-05-09
description: |
    The xz_head function in xzlib.c in libxml2 before 2.9.6 allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted LZMA
    file, because the decoder functionality does not restrict memory usage to what
    is required for a legitimate file.
