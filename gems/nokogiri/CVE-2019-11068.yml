title: Backport libxslt patch
description: |
  libxslt through 1.1.33 allows bypass of a protection mechanism because callers
  of xsltCheckRead and xsltCheckWrite permit access even upon receiving a -1
  error code. xsltCheckRead can return -1 for a crafted URL that is not actually
  invalid and is subsequently loaded.

  - ">= 1.10.3"
