title: HTML sanitization bypass in Sanitize
description: |-
  When HTML is sanitized using Sanitize's "relaxed" config or a custom config
  that allows certain elements, some content in a `math` or `svg` element may
  not be sanitized correctly even if `math` and `svg` are not in the allowlist.

  Using carefully crafted input, an attacker may be able to sneak arbitrary HTML
  through Sanitize, potentially resulting in XSS (cross-site scripting) or other
  undesired behavior when that HTML is rendered in a browser.
