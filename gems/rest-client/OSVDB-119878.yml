title: Rest-Client Gem for Ruby allows a remote attacker to conduct a session fixation attack
date: 2015-03-24
description: |
  rest-client Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in abstract_response.rb related to
  the handling of set-cookie headers in redirection responses that allows a
  remote, user-assisted attacker to conduct a session fixation attack. This
  flaw exists because the application, when establishing a new session, does
  not invalidate an existing session identifier and assign a new one. With
  a specially crafted request fixating the session identifier, a context-
  dependent attacker can ensure a user authenticates with the known
  session identifier, allowing the session to be subsequently hijacked.
