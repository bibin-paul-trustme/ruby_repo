title: git-fastclone Shell Metacharacter Injection Arbitrary Command Execution
date: 2015-12-15
description: |
  git-fastclone before 1.0.5 passes user modifiable strings directly to a shell
  command. An attacker can execute malicious commands by modifying the strings
  that are passed as arguments to "cd " and "git clone " commands in the
  library.
patched_versions:
  - ">= 1.0.5"
