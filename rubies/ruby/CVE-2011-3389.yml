title: "CVE-2011-3389 HTTPS: block-wise chosen-plaintext attack against SSL/TLS (BEAST)"
date: 2011-08-31
description: |
  The SSL protocol, as used in certain configurations in Microsoft
  Windows and Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google
  Chrome, Opera, and other products, encrypts data by using CBC mode
  with chained initialization vectors, which allows man-in-the-middle
  attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers via a blockwise
  chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) on an HTTPS session, in conjunction
  with JavaScript code that uses
  (1) the HTML5 WebSocket API,
  (2) the Java URLConnection API, or
  (3) the Silverlight WebClient API, aka a "BEAST" attack.
