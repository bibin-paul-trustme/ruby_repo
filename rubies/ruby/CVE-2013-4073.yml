title: "CVE-2013-4073 ruby: hostname check bypassing vulnerability in SSL client"
date: 2013-06-27
description: |
  The OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function in
  lib/openssl/ssl.rb in Ruby 1.8 before 1.8.7-p374,
  1.9 before 1.9.3-p448, and 2.0 before 2.0.0-p247
  does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in
  the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which
  allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers
  via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification
  Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
