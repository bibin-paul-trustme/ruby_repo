title: "CVE-2012-5371 ruby: Murmur hash-flooding DoS flaw in ruby 1.9 (oCERT-2012-001)"
date: 2012-11-23
description: |
  Ruby (aka CRuby) 1.9 before 1.9.3-p327 and 2.0 before r37575 computes
  hash values without properly restricting the ability to trigger hash
  collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to
  cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an
  application that maintains a hash table, as demonstrated by a universal
  multicollision attack against a variant of the MurmurHash2
  algorithm, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-4815.
