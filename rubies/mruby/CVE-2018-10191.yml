title: Use after free caused by integer overflow in environment stack
date: 2018-04-17
description: |
  In versions of mruby up to and including 1.4.0, an integer overflow
  exists in src/vm.c::mrb_vm_exec() when handling OP_GETUPVAR in the
  presence of deep scope nesting, resulting in a use-after-free.
  An attacker that can cause Ruby code to be run can use this to
  possibly execute arbitrary code.
