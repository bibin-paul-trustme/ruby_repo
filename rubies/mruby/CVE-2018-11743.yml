title: Use of uninitialized pointer in mrb_hash_keys
date: 2018-06-05
description: |
  The init_copy function in kernel.c in mruby 1.4.1 makes
  initialize_copy calls for TT_ICLASS objects, which allows attackers
  to cause a denial of service (mrb_hash_keys uninitialized pointer
  and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact.
